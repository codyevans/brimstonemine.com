                        <strong>The Mayflower Mine</strong> was a high-grade gold and silver producer discovered in the 1890’s by W. A. Clark, one of the Butte Copper Kings. The property was acquired by the Anaconda Company which operated the Mayflower Mine from 1935 to 1942. Subsequently, it was mined under a lease agreement with Anaconda from 1958-1961. The Mayflower Mine produced over 225,000 ounces of gold and over 875,000 ounces of silver from about 143,700 tons of ore. The average grade of ore contained 1.556 ounces per ton gold (opt Au) and 6.15 ounces per ton silver (opt Ag). The ore was of a high enough grade to be directly shipped, and therefore, no ore was milled on the project site. Mine production was from two shafts, and two principal ore shoots (eastern and western), with as many as fourteen working levels interconnected by stopes and raises that are developed to a depth of 1582 feet. These workings were driven to mine native gold, and gold- and silver-bearing telluride ores from a steeply dipping, silicified replacement zone. Replacement ore is hosted in the Cambrian-age Meagher Limestone adjacent to the high-angle, northeast-trending, Mayflower Fault.
