                    <h3>Access to Mayflower Assured</h3>
                    <p>
                        Brimstone Mining, Inc. is pleased to announce that a several yearlong litigation regarding the Company’s access rights to its property via the historic Mayflower Road has been finally resolved in the Company’s favor. In December 2000 a District Court found that Brimstone has a Prescriptive Easement dating back to the 1940’s and that ruling was subsequently upheld by the Montana Supreme Court. The Supreme Court did remand some details back to the District Court but those issues were resolved without further trial and a final stipulation was entered on May 14, 2004. With this final resolution access to the Mayflower Mine has been permanently assured.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Mayflower Mine was discovered in 1896 and quickly became Montana’s richest gold mine. Production continued until 1942 when the War Act caused western gold mines to be shut down. It was reopened from 1958 to 1961. In 1996 Brimstone Mining, Inc. acquired the property and commenced an aggressive program to rehabilitate the entire surface facility and shaft and then begin an exploration-drilling program. Over 20,000 ounces of high grade gold was delineated below the deepest workings of the mine. Several additional targets remain to be explored. The program was suspended because of low gold prices. The facility has been kept in good order and is ready for a renewed program with minimal effort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Mayflower Mine is free of debt, has clear title to fee simple property, is fully and modernly equipped, is permitted (minor updating required), and could be up and running in 4-5 weeks. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Brimstone Mining, Inc. - Montana Gold Opportunities</h3>
                    <p>
                        Brimstone Mining, Inc., a Montana corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Brimstone Mining, Inc., a Canadian corporation trading under the auspices of the Vancouver Stock Exchange, owns the Mayflower Mine in southwestern Montana. Brimstone has been actively working at the Mayflower for three years and has invested over $3 million in exploration and development costs. The mine is fully permitted and ready to commence a development program which will allow for the shipment of high-grade gold ore and exploration in several prospective areas. This mine is unique in that it sits on private ground which is wholly owned by the company. It is high-grade, it is underground, and the ore will be shipped direct to a nearby smelter. Since there has never been a milling facility on site and none is expected, the environmental liabilities at this project are minimal
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eight miles north of the Mayflower Mine, the company has identified another unique opportunity in the gold business. A major company has identified a 65,000-100,000 ounce deposit of gold beneath their open pit operations. Brimstone has negotiated with the owner for several months during which time substantial joint engineering activities were undertaken. The two companies are near to a decision which would afford Brimstone the opportunity to mine these reserves and process the ore at the owner's on-site facilities. All substantial permitting is in place and, like the Mayflower, this operation could be accomplished with minimal environmental risk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gold markets have been weak for the past two years but are currently showing strength and there seems to be market optimism. Nevertheless, Brimstone's traditional funding sources are not available, so an opportunity exists for an investor to join with a proven management team to develop these two low-risk (financial and environmental) operations. Investment could be through equity in the company as a private placement, convertible debenture, or a combination. It could also be done by way of a joint venture. Funding could also be done for either one or both of the projects and, if for both, they could be carried out jointly or sequentially. The final deal would be crafted to meet the funder's best interests, but Brimstone's preference would be some arrangement whereby most of the funding is provided as equity in the company rather than the project. This normally would work to the investor's best interest, too, because of the enhanced liquidity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each of the two projects requires about $4 million to be brought into production. Also, both have a lead time of about a year and a half from inception until first production. If developed concurrently, the total $8 million would have to be available on a schedule consistent with the development program. If approached sequentially, $4 million would have to be committed to an engineering schedule for the Deep Breccia and development capital for the Mayflower could be deferred until a later date. Gold markets would dictate how far Mayflower development would lag the Deep Breccia development.
                    </p>

                        These results when combined with the results from previously drilled holes demonstrates ore-grade mineralization, over minable widths, occurring from 165 to 440 feet below previous mining on the 1300 level of the eastern shoot. The minable strike length of the zone is at least 65 feet in the plane of the Mayflower fault, and this zone remains open to the west and locally to the east. These drill intercepts continue to define a significant strike length and downward extension of this historically mined eastern ore shoot. Underground drilling continues. See Brimstone Mining, Inc.’s web-site for additional information, maps and tables showing drill results (http://www.brimstonegold.com).

                        Brimstone Mining has completed an 80 foot long crosscut and initiated a 70 foot raise to evaluate a multi-once drill intercept located on the west Mayflower ore shoot between the 1100 and 1200 levels. The targeted drill intercept includes 6.3 feet (true width) of 1.710 opt Au and 3.49 opt Ag. The crosscut to the structure is complete and has intercepted the mineralized fault zone below and to the west of the mineralized drill hole. The zone, at this location, contains significant pyrite and marcasite as fracture controlled mineralization, but was not expected to, and does not contain ore grade gold mineralization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brimstone Mining Inc. has completed the shipping of 7,420 tons of low-grade material grading 0.181 opt Au and 1.05 opt Ag for processing at a nearby mine.

                        These holes when combined with three previously drilled core holes demonstrate ore grade mineralization, over minable widths, occurring from 220 to 440 feet below the previous deepest mining (1300 level) on the eastern shoot, and continue to document the continuity of bonanza-ore-grades in a significant downward extension of this historically mined zone.

                        Visible free gold in hole 98-38 occurs in intensely sheared and brecciated rock along the Mayflower fault zone, as both disseminations and in thin dark-gray quartz veinlets in a highly silicified and altered limestone host. Other gold- and silver-mineralization occurs as finely disseminated telluride phases. Roscoelite, a greenish colored vanadium-rich mica, was identified and is abundant in these high-grade intercepts. Roscoelite has been described as being common in the higher grade ore-zones mined by previous operators of the Mayflower Mine.

                    <p>
                        Multi-ounce (including tens of ounces per ton) gold and silver assays were not uncommon from historical operations at the Mayflower Mine, and are evidenced by both shipping and smelter receipts, as well as by ore-car assay values from historical Anaconda Company records.

                        Brimstone Mining has also initiated an 80 foot long crosscut and a 70 foot raise to evaluate a multi-once drill intercept located on the west Mayflower ore shoot between the 1100 and 1200 levels. This drill intercept includes 6.3 feet (true width) of 1.420 opt Au and 4.20 opt Ag.

                    <p>
                        Brimstone Mining, Inc. announces that a drift has reached the east ore shoot in the 1300 level at its Mayflower Mine.  The 180 food slusher drift was driven because a cave blocked the original 1300 level access.   Ground conditions around the winze to the 1400 level and a 1300 level drill station are good.  After a few days of clean up, a diamond drill will be moved to a drill station adjacent to the eastern ore shoot.  This drill will initially explore for high-grade reserves located between the 1100 and 1400 levels.  Historical production from the lower portion of the eastern ore shoot, which was mined from 1958 to 1961, includes 40, 869 ounces of gold and 251,606 ounces of silver from 16,888 tons of ore (average grade 2.42 opt gold and 14,9 opt silver).

                    <p>
                        Brimstone has also reached an agreement with a nearby mine to ship about 7,000 tons of Mayflower ore for processing.   The material, stockpiled by an earlier operator, averages 0.184 opt gold and 1.05 opt silver.  In February, Brimstone shipped 545 tons grading 0.223 opt gold and 1.83 opt silver to the ASARCO smelter in East Helena, Montana.

                        Brimstone Mining, Inc. has commenced shipping stockpiled gold/silver ore from its Mayflower Mine in Montana.  Brimstone has an agreement with ASARCO Smelter in East Helena, Montana for an initial shipment of   about 500 tons which sampled about 0.573 opt gold and 8.61 opt silver.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brimstone has also completed a drilling program on another stockpile at the Mayflower Mine.  405 feet of reverse circulation drilling, in 28 drill holes indicates approximately 5,600 tons of ore grading about 0.20 opt gold and 1.4 opt silver which will be shipped to ASARCO or another purchaser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to preliminary sampling these stockpiles contain approximately 1,430 ounces of gold and 3,300 ounces of silver.

                        De-watering of the West Mayflower shaft is complete and the shaft has been rehabilitated to the 1300 level.  Once rehabilitation of the 1300 level is complete, a drill will be moved to a drill station adjacent to the eastern ore shoot.   This drill will initially explore for unmined high-grade resource located between the 1200 and 1400 levels.  Additional drilling from this station will seek to confirm and delineate resources identified in two holes drilled by Anaconda in 1961, in which a drill indicated resource of about 10,000 ounces of gold and 75,000 ounces of silver was identified in intercepts lying some 300-375 feet below the 1300 level workings.   Exploration drilling will also be conducted from the 1300 level to the northeast, parallel to the western and eastern shoots.

                    <h3>Additional Ore-grade Intercepts from Underground Drilling</h3>
                    <p>
                        Brimstone Mining, Inc. announces additional ore-grade intercepts from underground drilling targeting a zone of mineralization underlying the western ore shoot, and the completion de-watering of the West Mayflower Shaft at it’s Mayflower Mine property located in south-central Montana, USA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A total of 9327.5 feet of core have been drilled to date in twenty-four (24) holes. Drilling has been conducted from the 1000, 1100 and 1200 level shaft stations, exploring for a downward extension of the historically mined, steeply dipping, gold-, silver-, and telluride-bearing western ore shoot between the 950 and 1300 levels. The western ore shoot was mined from the surface to the 1000 level in a series of raises and open stopes and exhibits continuity of grade over a distance of 75 to 125 feet laterally within in the plane of the structure, with mined widths varying from as narrow as 2.5 to as wide as 22 feet. Production of ore below the 1000 level ceased during the second world war as the result of a government act which prohibited mining of metals deemed non-essential to the war effort
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All but three of the holes drilled to date encountered the targeted mineralized zone. The silicified, and locally iron-oxide stained and brecciated limestone along the fault zone is mineralized with disseminated, stockwork veins, and replacement zones of marcasite. Locally native gold and telluride mineralization also occurs within the zone as disseminations and in narrow dark gray cross-cutting veinlets. Visible native gold and a gold- and silver-bearing telluride (petzite?) were observed in some drill intercepts.

                        In addition, six (6) other holes (including 97-9 with lost core) report anomalous gold and silver mineralization. These include: hole 97-4, with 2.5 feet of 0.088 opt Au and 0.16 opt Ag; hole 97-8, with 7.4 feet of 0.021 opt Au and 0.16 opt Ag; hole 97-9, with 0.030 opt Au and 0.52 opt Ag; hole 97-11 with 3.3 feet of 0.011 opt Au and 0.11 opt Ag; hole 97-17, with 4.3 feet of 0.014 opt Au and 0.22 opt Ag; and hole 97-20, with 3.6 feet of 0.074 opt Au and 0.30 opt Ag.

                        The results of this drilling indicate that ore grade mineralization occurs over a width of as much as 160 feet within the plane of replacement mineralization along the fault, and at elevations from about thirty (30) feet above the 1000 level to as much as sixty (60) feet below the 1100 level (an actual distance of 220 feet). These intercepts are significant in that they begin to delineate a new zone of ore-grade mineralization directly underlying and continuous with the historically mined western ore shoot. Additional drilling is planned.

                        De-watering of the West Mayflower Shaft is complete and the shaft has been rehabilitated to the 1300 level.. Rehabilitation of the 1300 level is underway and track is being laid to access the lower working levels of the eastern ore shoot, which lies parallel to and approximately 800 feet northeast of the western ore shoot. Once this rehabilitation is complete a drill will be moved to a drill station adjacent to the eastern ore shoot. This drill will initially explore for unmined high-grade reserves located between the 1200 and 1400 levels.

                        Additional drilling from this station will seek to confirm and delineate resources identified in two holes drilled by Anaconda in 1961. Both of these core holes targeted the eastern ore shoot at depth, below the 1300 level workings. One hole intercepted 7.0 feet of 2.019 opt Au and 22.6 opt Ag, 300 feet below the 1300 level. The second hole encountered 4.6 feet of 0.431 opt Au and 4.87 opt Ag at a depth of 375 feet below the 1300 level. A drill indicated resource of 10,000 ounces of gold and 75,000 ounces of silver was calculated for this zone. Drilling will also be conducted from the 1300 level to explore for ore zones that may lie further to the northeast, parallel to the western and eastern shoots.

                        The Mayflower Mine is an historically operated underground gold/silver mine located about 30 miles southeast of Butte, Montana. This mine produced over 225,000 ounces of gold and 875,000 ounces of silver from 143,700 tons of ore (average grade of 1.556 opt gold and 6.15 opt silver). Mine production was from two shafts accessing two ore shoots (western and eastern), with working levels interconnected by stopes that are developed to a depth of 1582 feet. These workings were developed to mine native gold, and gold- and silver-bearing telluride ores from a steeply dipping, silicified replacement zone. Replacement ore is hosted in the Cambrian Meagher Limestone immediately adjacent to the high-angle, northeast-trending, Mayflower Fault. Brimstone Mining, Inc. has renovated the western shaft to the 1300 level and installed a new headframe, hoist, and electrical sub-station in support of its exploration program. Underground exploration drilling, de-watering and level rehabilitation continue using two shifts per day five (5) days a week.

                    <h3>Significant Ore-grade Mineralization from Underground Drilling Intercepts</h3>
                   <p>
                    Brimstone Mining, Inc. announces the discovery of significant ore-grade mineralization from underground drilling intercepts targeting a zone underlying the western ore shoot at it’s Mayflower Mine property located in south-central Montana, USA.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The Mayflower Mine is an historically operated high-grade underground gold/silver shaft mine located in the northern Tobacco Root Mountains, about 30 miles southeast of Butte, Montana. The Mayflower Mine produced over 225,000 ounces of gold and over 875,000 ounces of silver from about 143,700 tons of ore. The average grade of ore contained 1.556 ounces per ton gold and 6.15 ounces per ton silver. Mine production was from two shafts, and two principal ore shoots (western and eastern), with working levels interconnected by stopes and raises that are developed to a depth of 1582 feet. These workings were driven to mine native gold, and gold- and silver-bearing telluride ores from a steeply dipping, silicified replacement zone. Replacement ore is hosted in the Cambrian age Meagher Limestone immediately adjacent to the high-angle, northeast-trending, Mayflower Fault. Brimstone Mining, Inc. has renovated the western shaft to the 1200 level and installed a new headframe, hoist, and electrical sub-station at the mine site in support of its exploration program. Underground exploration drilling, and ongoing mine shaft de-watering and rehabilitation continue using two shifts per day five (5) days a week.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Underground exploration drilling began at the Mayflower Mine on October 30th with one drill, and a second drill was added on November 7th. A total of 3,881.4 feet of core have been drilled to date in ten (10) holes, one additional hole was lost. The first drill began drilling from the 1000 level shaft station, and the second from the 1100 level shaft station. Both drills are exploring for downward extensions of the historically mined, steeply dipping, gold and silver telluride-bearing western ore shoot between the 1000 and 1200 levels. This historically producing zone was mined from the surface to the 1000 level in a series of raises and open stopes and shows continuity of grade and minable reserves over a distance of 75 to 125 feet laterally within in the plane of the structure, with minable widths varying from as narrow as 2.5 to as wide as 22 feet. Production of ore below the 1000 level ceased during the second world war as the result of a government act which prohibited mining of metals deemed non-essential to the war effort. Some development drifting below the 1000 level was completed prior to that time and could be used for future production access.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    All ten holes drilled to dated encountered the target zone in approximately the predicted location. The silicified, iron oxide stained and locally brecciated limestone along the fault zone was everywhere mineralized with disseminated, stockwork veins, and replacement zones of pyrite. Locally native gold and telluride mineralization also occurs within the zone as disseminations and in narrow cross-cutting veinlets. Visible native gold was observed in some drill intercepts. Three drill holes report significant ore grade mineralization. The drill hole number, footage, true width, and assay and composite assay values are reported in the table below. Assaying is being conducted by two different laboratories. One is a local laboratory (Mt. Powell Labs) providing a twenty four hour turn around on gold and silver assays. These assay results are being used to provide information for the timely and effective siting of drill holes targeting the mineralized zone. The other laboratory is Chemex Laboratories of Vancouver, BC. Chemex analyzes the coarse rejects from the MT Powell samples and this results in the discrepancies in assay values reported below. But in all cases the assay values reported are of ore-grade and the expected discrepancies are reasonable. Metallic screen test assays are currently being conducted by Chemex for each of the zones reported below.

                    n addition, three (3) other holes report anomalous gold and silver mineralization in the target zone. These include: hole 97-4, with 2.5 feet of 0.088 opt Au and 0.16 opt Ag; hole 97-8, with 7.4 feet of 0.021 opt Au and o.16 opt Ag; and hole 97-11 with 3.3 feet of 0.011 opt Au and 0.11 opt Ag. The four (4) remaining drill hole intercepts exhibited pyrite mineralization within the zone, but reported no significant assay values.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The results of this initial drilling indicate that ore grade mineralization occurs in drill holes over a width of as much as 160 feet within the plane of replacement mineralization along the fault zone and at elevations from about thirty (30) feet below the 1000 level to as much as sixty (60) feet below the 1100 level (an actual distance of 150 feet). Other reported anomalous gold mineralization encountered in the drill holes occurs between the 1000 and 1200 levels. These intercepts are significant in that they point to newly discovered zone of ore grade mineralization directly underlying and probably continuous with the historically mined overlying western ore shoot.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Additional drilling is warranted to delineate the zone of mineralization and is ongoing in the zone beneath the historically mined western ore shoot from the 1000 and 1100 levels. Underground drilling targeting this same zone is also planned from the 1200 and 1300 levels.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Following this initial round of drilling on the western ore shoot, one of these drills will move to the 1300 level about 1200 feet to the northeast from a drill station located on the eastern ore shoot to begin confirmation and definition drilling of previously identified resources located at depth by previous drilling some 300 to 375 feet below previously mined reserves.

                    <h3>Mayflower Mine Commences Underground Drilling and Continues Dewatering of the Shaft and Underground Workings</h3>
                   <p>
                    Brimstone Mining, Inc. announces the commencement of underground drilling, the initial shipment of stockpiled reserves, and the continuation of dewatering of the shaft and underground workings at it’s Mayflower Mine property located in south-central Montana, USA. The Mayflower Mine is an historically operated high-grade underground gold/silver shaft mine located in the northern Tobacco Root Mountains, about 30 miles southeast of Butte, Montana, and about eight miles south of Placer Dome’s Golden Sunlight Mine near Whitehall, Montana.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The Mayflower Mine produced over 225,000 ounces of gold and over 875,000 ounces of silver from about 143,700 tons of ore. The average grade of ore contained 1.556 ounces per ton gold and 6.15 ounces per ton silver. The ore was of a high enough grade to be directly shipped for processing. Mine production was from two shafts, and two principal ore shoots (eastern and western), with working levels interconnected by stopes and raises that are developed to a depth of 1582 feet. These workings were driven to mine native gold, and gold- and silver-bearing telluride ores from a steeply dipping, silicified replacement zone. Replacement ore is hosted in the Cambrian age Meagher Limestone immediately adjacent to the high-angle, northeast-trending, Mayflower Fault.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Two underground drills have been mobilized to the Mayflower Mines to begin underground exploration and definition drilling of potential reserves. The first drill began drilling today from the 1000 level shaft station exploring for a downward extension of the historically mined, steeply dipping, gold and silver telluride-bearing western ore shoot. This historically producing zone was mined from the surface to the 1000 level in a series of raises and open stopes and shows continuity of grade and minable reserves over a distance of 75 to 125 feet within in the plane of the structure, with minable widths varying from as narrow as 2.5 to as wide as 22 feet. A total of eight (8) holes consisting of about 2,500 feet of core drilling are planned from this initial underground drill station.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The second underground drill will be initially drilling from a drill station located near the 1100 level shaft station once that level has been completely dewatered and the drill station constructed. This drill will be exploring for a downward extension and underground reserves in the western ore shoot from the 1100 to the 1250 level. This drill is expected to commence drilling about November 3rd. Initially, 10 core holes are planned containing about 3000 feet of drilling. If minable reserves are identified there are nearby development workings available from which these reserves may be brought into production.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Underground definition drilling, and ongoing mine shaft and 1300 level drift rehabilitation will continue using two shifts (20 hours) per day seven days a week.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Dewatering continues to go well at the Mayflower Mine. Two stationary 150 horsepower constant displacement pumps (each producing 250 gallons per minute) have been installed along with an underground electrical substation on the 700 level. These pumps are being supplied by a 150 horsepower submersible pump presently located at the 1200 level. The initial standing water level in the Mayflower shaft was at 600 feet and the sump at the bottom of the shaft is at 1582 feet. The present water level after about 3 weeks of pumping is at the 1100 level.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Following this initial round of drilling on the western ore shoot, one of these drills will move to the 1300 level about 1200 feet to the northeast to a drill station located on the eastern ore shoot to begin confirmation and definition drilling of previously identified resources located at depth by previous drilling some 300 to 375 feet below previously mined reserves (see previous news release dated (9/ /97).
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Brimstone Mining, Inc. has reached an agreement whereby the ASARCO Smelter located in East Helena, MT will receive an initial shipment of about 600 to 1000 tons of stockpiled "low" grade ore material for processing and initial testing of metallurgical processes and recoveries. This material will be shipped in early November. Preliminary sampling of this ore stockpile suggests that it contains about 0.495 opt gold and 8.61 opt silver. In addition, Brimstone Mining, Inc. has reached a tentative agreement to sample and ship an additional 7000 tons of stockpiled lower grade waste rock to a nearby mine for processing and additional metallurgical testing. This waste rock stockpile, based on preliminary sampling contains about 0.18 opt gold and 2.5 opt silver.

                    <h3>Brimstone Gold to Acquire Mayflower Mine Property</h3>
                    <p>
                        VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--Brimstone Mining, Inc. (the "Company") has received the approval of the Vancouver Stock Exchange to acquire the other 50 percent of the Mayflower Mine Property in Montana for 2,000,000 shares of the Company. This will result in the Company owning 100 percent of the Mayflower Property. The approval was contingent upon the Company closing the previously announced (January 28, 1997) brokered private placement with Eagle & Partners Inc., of Toronto, Ontario, of up to 5,000,000 Special Warrants at $0.55 each for gross proceeds of $2,750,000.

                        Brimstone further announces the initiation of mine rehabilitation work, which will lead to underground exploration drilling at its Mayflower Mine property located in south-central Montana, USA. The Mayflower Mine is an historically operated underground gold and silver mine located in the northern Tobacco Root Mountains, about 30 miles (48 km) southeast of Butte, Montana, and about eight miles (13 km) south of Placer Dome's Golden Sunlight Mine near Whitehall, Montana.

                        The Mayflower Mine was a high-grade gold and silver producer discovered in the 1890's by W.A. Clark, one of the Butte Copper Kings. The property was acquired by the Anaconda Company which operated the Mayflower Mine from 1935 to 1942. Subsequently, it was mined under a lease agreement with Anaconda from 1958 to 1961. The Mayflower Mine produced over 225,000 ounces of gold and over 875,000 ounces of silver from about 143,700 tons of ore. The average grade of ore contained 1.556 ounces per ton gold (opt Au) and 6.15 ounces per ton silver (opt Au). The ore was of a high enough grade to be directly shipped, and therefore, no ore was milled on the project site. Mine production was from two shafts, and two principal ore shoots, with as many as fourteen working levels interconnected by stopes and raises that are developed to a depth of 1582 feet. These workings were driven to mine native gold, and gold and silver bearing telluride ores from a steeply dipping, silicified replacement zone. Replacement ore is hosted in the Cambrian-age Meagher Limestone adjacent to the high-angle, northeast-trending, Mayflower Fault.

                        Two underground exploration core drill holes were drilled by Anaconda in 1961 from the 1300 level. Both of these holes targeted the western ore shoot at depth, below existing workings. One hole intercepted 7.0 feet (2.1m) of 2.019 opt Au and 22.6 opt Ag, 300 feet (91.5m) below the 1300 level. The second hole encountered 4.6 feet (1.4m) of 0.431 opt Au and 4.87 opt Ag at a depth of 375 feet (114m) below the 1300 level. A drill indicated resource of about 10,000 ounces of gold and 75,000 ounces of silver was calculated by Anaconda for this zone. Brimstone's initial exploration drill program will seek to confirm and offset these unmined intercepts. In addition, this drill program will explore for extensions of the eastern ore shoot at depth, below the 1000 level. A drill program of about 10,000 feet of underground core drilling is planned.

                        Brimstone's Montana subsidiary, Brimstone Mining, Inc., will conduct the initial exploration and pre-production development phases of work at the Mayflower Mine under a Small Miner's Exclusion Permit which has already been obtained from the State of Montana. If a minable reserve is identified, either during mine rehabilitation or from exploration drilling, mine production at a rate of as much as 100 tons per day is allowable under the Small Miners Exclusion.

                        Brimstone Mining has purchased a hoist and headframe combination. It is to undergo testing, refurbishing and then installation at the Mayflower Mine by RAM Engineering of Miami, Arizona. The hoist will initially be used for shaft rehabilitation and to support the underground exploration drill program. However, the hoist is capable of producing up to 200 tons/day from a depth of 2500 feet. The hoist is scheduled to be operational at the Mayflower Mine site by mid-May of 1997.

                        Brimstone Mining has also issued a letter of intent to Fausett Mine Services of Osburn, Idaho to begin rehabilitation of the shaft and other select portions of the Mayflower Mine workings, and to construct the underground drill stations, under a contract mining agreement. With the exception of the upper 100 feet, the timbers in the main shaft are in good condition and should require only minor rehabilitation work. Electrical sub-station design and construction work has been initiated with the Montana Power Company. Work at the project site is scheduled to begin on February 24, 1997.

                        Exploration drilling from the 1100 level is scheduled to begin in late June of 1997.
